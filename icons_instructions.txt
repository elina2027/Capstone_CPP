ICONS INSTRUCTIONS

For your browser extension, you need to create two icon files:

1. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels
2. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

These should be placed in the root directory of your extension.

Icon suggestions:
- A magnifying glass icon would be appropriate for a search extension
- Use a color scheme that matches your extension (the primary color in your CSS is #4285f4)
- Make sure the icons are clear and recognizable at their respective sizes

You can create these icons using image editing software or download suitable icons from icon libraries (ensuring you have proper permissions to use them).
